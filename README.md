Trip With My Family
Last year, my family gave my brother a nice birthday present.
First of all, we had to be ready to go to the amusement park, after 30 minutes We drove to Tel-Aviv and the park near ''Azrieli Towers''
, next, We met my uncle and my uncle's sons, we didn't eat cause we will be in movement games, then, we went to the amusement park after entering the park every person went to his favorite game,
we still in the park for 3 hours and a half, after this time we quit from the park and went to the restaurant to eat some food, after the restaurant we went to the cinema and we watched a good movie, after the movie we were so happy and our smile was shown in our face, I was feeling lively after this trip and I was so happy I felt that it was my birthday, not my brother's.
I wish that I could return to this moment and to return to this feeling.
